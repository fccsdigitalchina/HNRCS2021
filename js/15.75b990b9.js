In recent years, the digitization of source materials, the proliferation of databases, as well as the development of digital tools, have greatly facilitated the study of networks in Chinese studies. To promote interdisciplinary dialogue between network scholars specializing in different periods of China and beyond, Henrike Rudolph and CHEN Song, edited a special issue for the Journal of Historical Network Research. Based on stellar contributions to the special issue, this conference showcases recent scholarship that applies the methodology and technology of network analysis to the study of diverse topics in Chinese history. "),(0,s.Wm)("p",null," The conference features a mix of multi-paper panels, project presentations, and hands-on workshops. Multi-paper panels feature scholarship empowered by network analysis and stimulate further discussion on the methodology and its application to the study of Chinese history; project presentations give brief introductions to databases and web platforms for network analysis and visualization; and workshops are interactive and focus on technical know-hows and encourage more scholars to dip their toes in this field. We aim to strike a balance between workshops for beginners and those for scholars who have already had some experience with the network analysis approach. The conference will be held on Zoom and on the mornings of July 23, 24, 30, and 31. To reach out to as wide an audience as possible, the conference will be hosted by the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies. We will hold the conference from 9am to 11:30am EDT, so that people from the US West Coast, Europe and East Asia can all participate.
